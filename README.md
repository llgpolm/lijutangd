# loss-landscapes

`loss-landscapes` is a library for approximating the value of neural network loss functions in low-dimensional 
subspaces suitable for visualization. The intended purpose of this library is to simplify the production of loss 
landscape visualizations such as those seen in [Visualizing the Loss Landscape of 
Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913v3).
